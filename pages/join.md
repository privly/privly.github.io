Privly is about creating a square deal for users, and that can't be done with a closed-source, proprietary platform. Anyone can add their skills to the project and their contribution will be protected by a [federally recognized](https://www.privly.org/content/privly-gains-non-profit-status) non-profit called the [Privly Foundation](https://privly.org).

## <a href="https://github.com/privly"><i class="fa fa-certificate"></i></a> Organization: <span style="font: normal 32px Lobster;">The Privly Foundation</span>

Privacy on the internet is not something that can--or should--be owned. Privly's 2012 [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/229630898/protect-your-content-anywhere-on-the-web-privly) funded the creation of the Privly Foundation. Incorporating the technology into a [recognized](https://www.privly.org/content/privly-gains-non-profit-status) 501(c)3 tax-exempt foundation ensures the mission focus of Privly will be maintained. We thank our many donors on the  [Privly donation page](/pages/donate).

More information about the Privly Foundation can be found on  [www.privly.org](http://privly.org). The inaugural Privly Foundation board [meeting](https://www.privly.org/content/privly-foundation-minutes-9-18-12) took place in September 2012 with the following board members:
